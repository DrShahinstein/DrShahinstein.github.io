## Collectivism and Individualism
### Ellsworth Toohey
- "Don't think I don't want to see you, Ellsworth. It's just... I told my mom not to let anyone in, but that was for the reporters. They won't leave me alone."

- "How times have changed, Peter! I remember when we used to force you away from journalists."

- "Ellsworth, I have no sense of humor left. None."

- "You're lucky. Otherwise you would have died laughing."

- "I'm so tired, Ellsworth. I'm glad you came."

The light shone through Toohey's lenses and Keating could no longer see his eyes. Two circles filled with a lonely metallic glow. Like dim automobile headlights reflecting something approaching in the distance.

- "Do you think you can get away with it?" Toohey asked.

- "With what?"

- "With his hermit act. Great regret. Faithful silence."

- "Ellsworth, what's wrong with you?"

- "So he's not guilty, is that it? So you want us to leave him alone, is that it?"

Keating's shoulders moved. Not so much sitting up straight, but like an intention to do so. Intention was something. His jaw moved a little, a question came out of his mouth.

- "What do you want?"

- "The whole story."

- "Why?"

- "Shall I make it easy for you? Do you want a good apology? I can offer it if you want. I can even give you thirty-three reasons. All noble reasons. You'd swallow them all in an instant, but I don't feel like making it easy for you. I'd rather tell you the truth. To send him to jail. His hero, his god, his generous friend, his guardian angel."

- "I have nothing to say to you, Ellsworth."

- "Before you lose the last shred of your sanity to this shock, protect it well enough to realize that you were never in my league. If I want you to talk, then you will talk. And I have no intention of wasting time. Who designed Cortland?"

- "Ben."

- "Don't you know I'm an architecture expert?"

- "I designed Cortlandt."

- "As you designed the Cosmo-Slotnick building?"

- "What do you want from me?"

- "I want you on the stand, Peter. I want you to tell your story in court. Your friend is not as outgoing as you are. I don't know what his intentions are. It's a bit clever of him to stay at the scene and wait. He knows he's already under suspicion, so he's being cunning. God knows what he intends to say in court. I can't let him get away with it. Everyone's obsessed with why he did it. I know why. If I try to explain, no one will believe me, but you can tell them as a sworn witness. You can tell the truth. You can tell them who designed Cortlandt and why it happened the way it did."

- "I designed it."

- "If you intend to say that on that podium, you're going to have to do something about your muscle control. Why are you shaking so badly?"

- "Leave me alone."

- "You're too late, Peter. Have you ever read Faust?"

- "What do you want?"

- "Howard Roark's head."

- "He's not my friend. He never has been. You know how I feel about him."

- "I know, you stupid fool! I know you've been worshipping him all your life. You stabbed him in the back while you knelt before him and worshipped him. You didn't even have the courage to be a traitor. You didn't choose one way or the other. You hated me... You didn't realize I knew, did you? You always watched me, but even though you loved her, you ruined her. Yes, you did, Peter. And now there's nowhere to run. You have to go on with this now!"

- "What do you care? What difference does it make to you?"

- "You should have asked me that a long time ago, but you didn't. So you knew. You've always known. That's what makes you tremble. Why should I help you lie to yourself? I did it for ten years. That's why you came to me. Everyone comes to me for that. But you don't get anything for free. You never do. Forget all my socialist theories to the contrary. You got what you wanted from me. Now it's my turn."

- "I don't talk about Howard. You can't make me talk about Howard."

- "Oh, yeah? Why don't you throw me out? Why don't you grab me by the throat and strangle me? You're so much stronger than me, but you can't. You can't. Can you see what power is now, Peter? Physical power? Your muscles, your guns, your money? You should really get together with Gail Wynand. You have a lot to tell her. Come on, Peter. Who designed Cortlandt?"

- "Leave me alone."

- "Who designed Cortlandt?"

- "Let go of me!"

- "Who designed Cortlandt?"

- "It's worse... This is what you did... worse..."

- "Why is it worse?"

- "What I did to Lucius Heyer."

- "What have you done to Lucius Heyer?"

- "I killed him."

- "What are you talking about?"

- "That's why it was better. I let him die."

- "Stop talking nonsense."

- "Why do you want to kill Howard?"

- "I don't want to kill him. I want to put him in jail. Do you understand? Jail. In a cell. Behind bars. I want to lock him up, stop him, tie him up. While he's alive. He'll get up when I tell him to get up. Eat whatever they give him. Move when they tell him to move, stop when they tell him to stop. He'll be taken to work, he'll work when they order him to. If he doesn't move fast, they will push him. They will slap him in the face when they feel like it. If he doesn't obey, they will beat him with rubber truncheons. And he will obey. He will _listen_ to _orders_. He will listen to orders!"

"Ellsworth!" cried Keating. "Ellsworth!"

- "You make me sick. Can't you stand to hear the truth? No, you want everything sugar-coated, is that it? That's why I prefer Gus Webb. He's not delusional."

Mrs. Keating opened the door. She had heard the screams.
"Get out of here!" Toohey snapped at him.
She backed away, Toohey slammed the door shut.
Keating raised his head.

- "You have no right to talk to my mom like that. She has nothing to do with you."

- "Who designed Cortlandt?"

Keating stood up. He shuffled to the chest of drawers, pulled out a drawer, took out a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Toohey. It was his agreement with Roark.

Toohey read the text and giggled once. It was a dry sound. Then he looked at Keating.

- "You're a great success, Peter. My achievement, of course, but sometimes I don't even want to see my own achievement."

Keating was standing by the closet. His shoulders slumped, his eyes blank.

- "I didn't expect you to give it to me in writing, with his signature. So that's what he did for your sake. And you in return... you know what you've done. No, I take back my insults, Peter. You had to do it. Who are you to reverse the rules of history? Do you know what this paper is? An impossible perfection, the dream of centuries, the goal of all human philosophy. You put the reins on it. You made it work for you. You stole its success, its prize, its money, its fame, its name. We had only thought about it and expressed it in articles. But you put it into practice. Every thinker since Plato owes you thanks. Here is the philosophers' stone. To turn gold into lead. I should be pleased, but I guess I can't be pleased because I'm human. I can't help it. I feel sick inside. All the others, Plato included, sincerely believed that lead could be turned into gold. But I knew the truth from the beginning. I've been honest with myself, Peter. That's the hardest honesty. You all avoid it. At all costs. I don't blame you now. It really is the hardest, Peter."

He sat down wearily, holding the paper by the corner with both hands.

- "If you want to know how hard it is, I'll tell you. Make whatever sense you want to make of it. I don't expect any appreciation because I know that tomorrow I will give this paper to the prosecutor's office. Roark will never know. It doesn't matter to him if he does, but to tell you the truth, for a moment I felt like burning this paper."

He folded the paper carefully and put it in his pocket. Keating watched his movements with his eyes, moving his whole head as he did so. He was like a kitten watching a ball with a string tied to the end.

"People like you make me sick," Toohey said. "God, how they make me sick! Hypocritical sentimentalists! You follow me, you use what I teach, you benefit from it, but you don't have the courage to admit to yourself what you are doing. The truth makes you sick to your stomach. I guess that's your nature. And that is my greatest weapon. But... Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm so fed up! I have to give myself a rest now and then, away from you. That's why I've had to pretend all my life. Because of little, worthless ticks like you. To preserve your sensibilities, your airs and graces, your conscience and the peace of mind you don't have. That's the price I have to pay for what I want. But at least I know what price I have to pay, and I'm not delusional about the price I pay or what I get in return."

- "What do you want... Ellsworth?"

- "I want power, Peter."

Footsteps were heard in the upper apartment. Someone was jumping up and down with glee. Then came clicks like the first four beats of a quintet. The light on the ceiling swayed, and Keating's head snapped up obediently. Then he looked at Toohey again. Toohey was smiling. He looked almost indifferent.

- "You... you always said..."

Keating's voice was hoarse. He stopped in mid-sentence.

- "Yes, that's what I've always said, loud and clear. It's not my fault if you couldn't hear it. You could have heard, but you didn't want to. For me, it's safer than deafness. I always said I wanted to rule. Like my spiritual ancestors, but I'm luckier than them. I've inherited the fruits of their endeavors. I am also fortunate to see the big dream realized. Today, wherever I look around me, I can see them. I recognize them. I don't like it. I don't expect to like it. It is not my destiny to enjoy. I can feel as much satisfaction as my capacity allows. But I will be in charge."

- "Who..."

- "You. The world. It's all about finding the handle of the lever. Once you learn how to rule the soul of one man, you can rule all other men. It's the soul, Peter, the soul. Whips, swords, bullets, guns are useless. That's why Caesars, Attila the Hun, Napoleons were small men, why they couldn't carry on. We will carry on. The soul is the unmanageable thing, Peter. It has to be broken, crushed. When you stick a stick in there and prick your fingers, you've got the man. You don't need a whip. He'll bring it to you himself, begging you to beat me. Once you put him in reverse gear, the mechanism inside him will do everything by itself, the way you want it. You will use the man against himself. You want to know how to do it? See if I've ever lied to you. This is not the first time you've heard me say these things. You've been hearing it for years, but you choose not to. It's not my fault, it's yours. There are many ways to do it. Here's one. Make him feel small. Make him feel guilty. Kill his hopes and the integrity of his personality. It's hard work. Even the worst among you has always chosen an ideal according to his own warped vision, and is trying to reach it. Kill your integrity with an internal corruption. Use it against yourself. Direct it towards a goal that will destroy your total honesty. Give advice to **erase your ego**. Tell it **you must live for others**. The most important thing is to be charitable, to donate, to help, to give of yourself. No one has ever been able to do this completely, and no one ever will be able to. But can you see what it will achieve? **That man will quickly see that he can never achieve what he considers to be the noblest virtue. Then he will feel guilty, he will feel sinful, he will believe that he is unworthy.** When the highest ideal is beyond his reach, he will give up all his ideals, all his hopes, all his belief in his own self-worth. He will feel obliged to preach to others what he cannot do. One cannot be half good or half honest. Maintaining the integrity of personality is a difficult battle. Why should he try to maintain such a thing when he knows that he is corrupt within himself? His soul then ceases to respect itself. She has him now. He will obey. He will be glad to obey. Because he cannot trust himself. He feels insecure. He feels dirty. That's one way."

"Let me tell you another way. Kill a man's sense of values. Kill his capacity to recognize or achieve what is called greatness. Great people cannot be ruled. We don't want a great man, but don't deny the concept of greatness. Destroy it from within. Greatness is rare, elusive, exceptional. Set such standards that everyone can reach them. The most ordinary, the least talented, the most incompetent. Then you kill the striving for achievement in all people, big and small. You kill the drive to get better, to achieve perfection, to reach perfection. Laugh at Roark, introduce Peter Keating as the great architect. Then you have succeeded in ruining architecture. Glorify Lois Cook, make her accepted, and you've ruined literature. Applaud Ike, and you have destroyed the theater. Praise Lancelot Clokey, and you've destroyed the press. Don't tear down great monuments. Then you will frighten people. **Praise the mediocre, the ordinary, the worthless, then there will be no great monuments anyway.**" _(This is why I distance myself from people who like everything, don't choose, don't discriminate, insist on not thinking. Not being able to call ass an ass glorifies mediocrity. Not being able to call an ass an ass causes Matrix 4 to be filmed. It causes everyone who has a mouth to sing. It causes every one who says 'I rule' to become a politician, every one who reads to become an 'intellectual'...)_

"There is another way. Kill with laughter. Laughter is the instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a tool of destruction. Turn it around and use it to mock. It's very simple. Tell them to laugh at everything. Tell them a sense of humor is a limitless virtue. If you leave nothing sacred in your soul, it can no longer be sacred in its own eyes. When you kill respect, you kill the heroism in man. One cannot show respect by giggling. He obeys and cannot put limits on his obedience. He laughs at anything. Nothing is too serious for him to laugh at."

"Do you want one more way? That's the most important thing. Don't let people be happy. Happiness is a self-sufficient emotion and has a way of turning you inward. Happy people don't have time for you, they don't care about you. Happy people are free people. So you have to kill their joy of living. Take away everything that is valuable and important to them. Never let them get what they want. Make them believe that personal desire is evil. Make them unable to consider it their natural right to say 'I want'. Make them ashamed of it. This is where charity will help you a lot. Unhappy people come to you. They need you. They come to be consoled, to find support, to be saved. There is no room for emptiness in nature. Once you empty a person's soul, you can fill it. I don't understand why you look so shocked, Peter. This trick is the oldest of them all. Look back in history. Look at all the great moral systems. Starting all the way back to the Eastern world. Don't they all preach the sacrifice of personal pleasure? Isn't there always the same goal underneath all that verbiage? Sacrifice, don't get carried away, deny yourself... Isn't that a lie? Don't you know the refrain they keep repeating: 'Give up, give up, give in, give in, give in.' Look at the spiritual atmosphere today. Whatever is pleasurable, from smoking to sex, to ambition, to profit, everything is considered a sin. As soon as you prove that something makes you happy, you are considered to have cursed it. We have reached these stages now. We've linked happiness to guilt, and of course we've got mankind by the throat. Sacrifice your firstborn child... Lie on a board full of nails... Walk into the desert, torment your body... Don't dance... Don't go to the movies on Sundays... Don't try to get rich... Don't smoke... Don't drink... It's always the same. The same advice. Fools think such taboos are just nonsense. They say it's a thing of the past, outdated, but nonsense always has a purpose. There's no need to analyze a madness, just ask yourself what it serves, what it accomplishes. **Whatever moral system preaches altruism has eventually become a superpower, ruling millions of people.** Of course, it needs a little embellishment. You have to tell people that if they sacrifice everything that makes them happy, they will achieve a higher happiness. You don't have to be too explicit about it. Use big, vague words. 'Universal harmony, eternal spirit, divine purpose, nirvana, heaven, racial superiority, dictatorship of the proletariat...' It's about degeneration from within, Peter. It's the oldest of methods. This farce has been played for centuries and people still swallow it. But it's so easy to test! Listen to what the self-proclaimed prophets say. If he talks about sacrifice, run away. Run as fast as you can, as if you were running away from the plague. When there is sacrifice, logically there will be someone who will pick up what has been sacrificed. If there is service, there is someone being served. The man who talks to you about sacrifice is actually talking about slaves and masters. He wants to be a master, but if you find someone who tells you to be happy, who tells you that this is your natural right, who tells you that your first duty is to yourself, then that man is not after your soul. He is not trying to get anything from you. The moment such a person appears, you all start shouting with your empty heads. He's a selfish monster, you say. In that case, the robbery will go on for centuries, there is nothing to be afraid of, but by the way, you may have noticed something that came out of my mouth. At one point I used the word 'logically'. Don't you understand? People have a weapon to make themselves afraid of you: Logic. That's why it's imperative that you take it away from them. Dynamite their foundations. But you have to be careful. Don't deny it right away. Don't deny anything, show your hand. Don't say logic is bad. Although some have gone so far as to do that too, and have achieved unexpected successes... But just say that logic is limited. Say that there are other things above it. What is it? You don't have to be very specific about that. The field is wide anyway. You can find a lot of things. Call it instinct, call it emotion, call it revelation, call it divine intuition, call it dialectical materialism. If you get caught somewhere, if someone tells you that your doctrine is illogical, you are ready for that. You tell him that there are other things beyond logic. Don't try to think, _feel_, you say. You have to believe, you say. Once you have pushed logic aside, the field is yours, you have what you need, when you need it. You've got that man now. Can you rule the thinking man? We don't want thinking men."

Keating sat on the floor. Right next to the chest of drawers. He felt very tired, his legs buckled, he collapsed there, and then he settled down. He didn't want to leave that cabinet. He felt safer leaning against it. It was as if the letter he had delivered was still in that cupboard.

- "Peter, you've heard it all before. You've seen how I've practiced it for ten years. Why are you so disgusted now? There's no need to sit there shocked and shocked, looking at me with that superior, benevolent look on your face. You are part of this conspiracy. You've had your share, you can't leave now. You're afraid of where the road leads. I'm not. I'll tell you. It leads to the world of the future. The world I want. A world of obedience and unity."

"In that world, the thought in every man's head will not be his own thought, it will be to try to discover the thought in his neighbor's head, and that neighbor will not have his own thought, and he will try to discover the thought of the other neighbor, and of course he will not have his own thought... This is how it's going to go, Peter. It's going to go around the world because **everybody has to agree with everybody else.** In such a world, nobody will have anything they want. Everybody will direct his efforts to serve the will of his neighbor, and that neighbor will have no will of his own, and he will serve the will of the other neighbor, and that neighbor will have no will of his own... This is how the world will be circumnavigated again, Peter. Because everyone has to serve everyone else. In that world people will not work for an innocent incentive like money. He will work for that headless monster they call respectability. For other people to admire, to approve. So that they think well of him. For the opinion of people who are not allowed to have an opinion. Just an octopus with arms and no brain. Judgment, Peter? No, not judgment, opinion polls. An average of zeros... **Because individuality will never be allowed.** A world with the engine removed. One heart, pumped by hand. My hand and the hands of a few others like me. People like you who know how to capture the marvelous ordinary by the hair. **Those who don't jump up in anger when we call you ordinary, small, mediocre, ** those who love and accept those names. You little people will be sitting on a throne. You will be sanctified. You are the sole ruler. Any of the past rulers would envy your situation. Because there is no limit. God, prophet, king, all in one. The voice of the people. _Vox populi_. Ordinary, mediocre, general! You know what the opposite of ego is? Filler. Fasafiso. That's their rule. But even that has to be started one day by somebody. We will start it. _Vox dei_. We will enjoy unlimited obedience from people who have learned nothing but obedience. We will call it 'service'. We will give our medals to service. You will trample each other to see who surrenders better and more. There will be no other distinction to seek. There will be no other kind of personal achievement. Can you see Howard Roak in that picture? No? Then don't waste time with silly questions. **If an occasional maniac insists on being born, he won't live beyond the age of twelve. As soon as his brain starts working, he'll feel the pressure and explode. Pressure towards the void, towards the vacuum. Do you know what happens to deep-sea creatures when they're brought to light? That's what the Roarks of the future look like. The rest of you will _smile_ and _yield_. **The first frown of man is the first touch of the hand of God on his forehead. The touch of thought, but we will have neither God nor thought. Only smiles and votes. Automatic levers. They all say yes. Now, if you were a little smarter, if you were like your ex-wife, for example, you would ask me a question, 'What about you, the rulers? What about me? Ellsworth Monkton Toohey? And I would answer you, yes, you're right, and I'm not going to get any more than you are. I'll have no other purpose than to keep you, to keep you satisfied. Lying to you, complimenting you, flattering you, inflating your pride. To give lectures about people, about the common good. Peter, my poor friend, of all the people you know, I am the most self-destructive. I have even less independence than you. And I have just forced you to sell your soul. The way you use people, at least, is to get something out of them for yourself. I want nothing for myself. I use people for what I can do for them. That is my only function and my only satisfaction. I have no special purpose. I want power. I want the world of the future in my head. **Let everyone live for everyone. Let us sacrifice and not benefit. Let us always suffer, let no one enjoy, let progress stop. Let everything stagnate. There is equality in stagnation. Everyone submits to the will of everyone else. Universal slavery and not even a master. Not even that little bit of pride. Slavery to slavery. A great circle and complete equality. The world of the future."
### Howard Roark

- "Mr. Keating, can you tell me as a witness under oath whether you drew the project known as the Cortlandt Houses, which bears your signature?"

- "No, I didn't. I didn't draw it."

- "Who drew it?"

- "Howard Roark."

- "At whose request?"

- "At my request."

- "Why did you ask him to do that?"

- "Because I couldn't do it myself."

There was no tone of honesty in that voice because there was no effort to pronounce such a truth. It expressed neither truth nor lie. It was indifferent.

The prosecutor handed him a piece of paper. "Is this the agreement you signed?"
Keating held the paper in his hand.

- "Yes."

- "Is that Howard Roark's signature?"

- "Yes."

- "Would you please read the terms of this agreement to the jury?"

Keating read aloud. His voice was even. None of the audience in the hall could understand that this deal was being read for sensationalism. This was not a famous architect confessing his own incompetence. It was a student reciting a memorized lesson. As if, if he were interrupted, he would not start where he left off. He would have to start all over again.

Keating answered a lot of questions. As evidence, the prosecutor produced Roark's drawings of Cortlandt. Keating had kept them too. Then the prosecutor presented the clean copies Keating had made of them. Finally, he presented photographs of Cortlandt as it was built.

- "Why were you so vehemently opposed to the excellent structural changes proposed by Mr. Prescott and Mr. Webb?"

- "I was afraid of Howard Roark."

- "Now that you know his character, what did you expect him to do?"

- "He could do anything."

- "What do you mean?"

- "I don't know. I was scared. I've always been scared."

The questions went on and on. The event was unusual, but the audience was getting bored. It was as if the speaker was not the participant. Other witnesses spoke as if they were more deeply involved.

When Keating stepped down, the audience felt as if nothing had changed. It was as if the place had gone from full to empty. "The prosecution rests," the prosecutor said. The judge turned and looked at Roark. "Come in," he said. His voice was soft.

Roark stood up. "Your honor, I am not calling witnesses," he said. "I will testify and tell the story myself."

- "Swear."

Roark was sworn in. He stood just in front of the steps of the witness stand. The spectators looked at him. He didn't stand a chance. They felt it immediately. They could put aside the nameless resentment, the mistrust they automatically felt towards him. That way, for the first time, they could see him as he was. A man completely devoid of fear.

The fear they thought of was not the normal kind of fear. It was not a fear born in response to a concrete danger. It was a chaotic, unadmitted fear that they all lived with. They remembered moments when they were alone, when they wished they had said such brilliant words, but regretted that they could not find and say them, and felt hatred for those who had stolen that courage from them. They thought about how knowledgeable and powerful one is in one's own head, but the autoplay never translates into reality. Is it a dream? A self-deception? Or a murdered reality? Murdered before it was born. Murdered by that corrosive combination of emotions, the sum total of fear, need, addiction and hatred.

Roark stood before them as every man stands in his own mind. But Roark stood like that in front of a hostile crowd. In an instant, they all realized that it was impossible for him to feel hatred. In the blink of an eye, they grasped his conscious attitude. Each asked himself a question: "Do I need anyone's approval? Is it important? Am I bound?" For a moment every single person there became free. Free to look at all the people in the room with goodwill. It was a fleeting moment. That moment of silence just before Roark began to speak.

_(here comes Roark's defense!)_
"Thousands of years ago, someone discovered how to make fire. They probably burned him in that fire because he taught his fellow human beings how to make fire. He was seen as an evil man who collaborated with a demon that people feared, but after him, people had a fire to keep warm. That man left them a gift they had never imagined, he removed darkness from the earth. Centuries passed and then someone invented the wheel. He, too, was probably crushed to pieces on the wheel he taught his brothers. He was seen as an arrogant man who did forbidden things, but after him, people were able to travel across horizons. This man left them a gift they had never imagined, he opened the ways of the world."

"That man, that first unyielding man, appears in the first chapter of every great myth created by mankind from the beginning until today. Prometheus is chained and at the mercy of birds of prey because he stole the fire from the gods. Adam was condemned to suffer because he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Whatever the legend, in the shadows of humanity's memory, it is known that this beauty began with one man, and that man paid the price for his courage."

"Some men have emerged over the centuries who have taken the first steps towards new paths, armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals are different, but they all have one thing in common. The step is the first step, the path is a new path, the vision is not borrowed from anyone else, and the reaction to these people has always been hatred. Great creators... thinkers, artists, scientists, inventors... have always stood alone against the people of their time. Every great new idea was opposed. Every great new invention was condemned and cursed. The engine was dismissed as absurd, the airplane was thought impossible. The mechanical loom was considered a bad invention. Anesthesia was considered a sin. But people with unborrowed visions have nevertheless continued on their way. They fought, they suffered, they paid the price, but in the end they won."

"No creator has ever been moved by the thought of serving his brothers and sisters because his brothers and sisters have rejected his gift, and that gift has destroyed the inertial routine of people's lives. This person's only truth became his own purpose. His own reality, that he can do it in his own way, that he can achieve it. A symphony, a book, an engine, a philosophy, an airplane or a building... That is his purpose in life. That is his life. What matters to him is not those who hear, read, process, believe in, fly in or live in what he has created. The point is in the thing created, not in those who use it. It is the created thing that matters, not those who benefit from it. The thing created has shaped the reality of that person. He, too, has placed his reality above everything and everyone else."

"That person's vision, strength and courage come from his or her own soul. A person's soul is his own self. It is his identity, which we call his consciousness. Thinking, feeling, judging, acting are all functions of the ego."

"Creators are not egoless. That is the whole secret of their power. That is why that power is self-sufficient, self-motivated, self-motivated, self-creating. A first purpose, an energy, a life force, an initiator. The creators have served nothing and no one. They lived for themselves."

"Only by living for themselves have they achieved what is the crown of honor of humanity. Such is the nature, the nature of success."

"Man can only exist with his own mind. He comes into the world unarmed. His only weapon is his own brain. Animals find their food with their physical strength. Man has no claws, no sharp nails, no horns, no great muscular strength. He has to either plant his food in the ground or hunt for it. In order to sow, a thought process is needed. To hunt, he needs weapons, and so he needs to make weapons, which is a thought process. From this simplest necessity to the loftiest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, all that we are and all that we have arises from the one quality of man... the operation of a rational mind."

"But the mind is something that the **individual** has. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. It is an agreement or a compromise reached by a group of people, a process of compromise or an average of many individual thoughts. It is something of secondary importance. The primary action... the process of reasoning... is something that one person has to do alone. We can divide food among many people, but we cannot digest it in a collective stomach. Nor can anyone use his own lungs to think for someone else. All functions of body and soul are individual and private. They cannot be shared and they cannot be transferred."

"We inherit other people's thoughts. We inherit a little bit of the wheel. We take it and make a car. Then the car changes and becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane. But in this whole process, the only thing we take from others is the end product of their thinking. The power of action is the creative power that takes this final product, uses it as material, and from there creates the next step."

"This creative power cannot be given or taken. It cannot be shared or lent. It belongs to one person, one individual. What is created is the property of the creator. People learn from each other, but all learning is really just an exchange of material. No one can give someone else the capacity to think. But that capacity is our only means of survival."

"Nothing in this world is given to man ready-made. He has to produce everything he needs. Here man finds himself faced with a fundamental choice. He sees that he can only survive in one of two ways. Either through the independent workings of his own mind or as a parasite feeding on the minds of others. The creator initiates. The parasite borrows. The creator stands on his own against nature. The parasite always uses an intermediary against nature."

"The creator's concern is to conquer nature. The parasite's concern is to conquer people."

"The creator lives for his own work. He does not need other people. His primary purpose is within himself. The parasite lives as a second hand. He needs others. Others become his primary purpose."

"The basic need of the creator is independence. The rational mind cannot work under any compulsion. It cannot be constrained, it cannot be sacrificed, it cannot submit to other aims and thoughts. It demands complete independence in both functioning and purpose. **For a creator, all relations with people are secondary."

"The basic need of the second-hand man is to strengthen his ties with other people in order to be fed. He puts relationships first. He says that human beings exist to serve others. He speaks of self-sacrifice, of serving and helping."

"It is a doctrine that requires man to live for others, to put others before himself."

"No one can live for others. He cannot share his soul as he cannot share his body. But the second-handers use charity as a weapon of exploitation, changing the moral principles of mankind. People are taught all the ways of destroying the creator. They are taught that dependence is a virtue."

"The person who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is parasitic in his aims, and parasitizes those he serves. The only thing that can come out of this relationship is degeneration together. This is conceptually impossible. The closest thing to it in real life is someone who lives to serve others, and that is a slave. If even physical slavery seems an abominable concept, how much more abominable must spiritual slavery be!"

"The slave captured in battle has his own pride. He has resisted and sees his situation as a bad thing, but the man who willingly turns himself into a slave, who says he does it for love, is the lowest of creatures. He degrades the dignity of humanity, he degrades the concept of love. This is what underlies the doctrines of service, charity and aid."

"People have been taught that the highest virtue is to give, not to achieve. But man cannot give what has not been created. Creation must precede distribution, otherwise there is nothing to distribute. The needs of the Creator must precede the needs of all those who will benefit in the future. Yet, we are taught to appreciate the man who distributes gifts that he did not create more than the one who made those gifts possible. We praise an act of help, an act of charity. We shrug our shoulders at a success."

"People have been taught that their first duty is to relieve the suffering of others. But suffering is a disease. When people are faced with such a situation, they try to relieve it, to help. To make this the highest virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life. In order to be virtuous, one becomes willing to see others suffer. This is the structure of charity. The creative person is not interested in disease, he is interested in life. Nevertheless, thanks to the work of creators, diseases have been eliminated one by one. Diseases of the human body and soul have been prevented, and thus suffering has been prevented in a way that philanthropists and benefactors cannot do."

"Man has been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man of a different opinion. People are told that it is good to swim with the current. The creator is the man who swims against the current. People are taught that standing together is a good deed, but the creator is the man who stands alone."

"People are taught that 'ego' is a synonym for evil. The ideal of virtue is egolessness. But the creator is the egotist in the strict sense. The egoless person is one who does not think, does not feel, does not judge, does not act. These are all functions of the self."

"The reversal at this point is the most frightening. The subject is distorted, man is left with no choice, his freedom is destroyed. He is presented with two concepts in terms of the poles of good and evil. One is selfishness and the other is charity. The meaning of selfishness is defined as sacrificing others for oneself. Charity, on the other hand, is to sacrifice oneself for others. In both cases, then, man is bound to other people, and he is told to suffer one of two sufferings. Either he will suffer himself for the sake of others, or he will make others suffer for his sake. Finally, when it was said that man should enjoy his own suffering, the trap was closed for good. Man is now forced to accept masochism as his ideal, because the only opposite is sadism. This has been the most dishonest trick ever played on mankind."

"Thus addiction and suffering are shown to be the essentials of life."

"The choices are not between self-sacrifice and domination. The choices are between independence and dependence. The rule of the creator or the rule of the second hand. This is a fundamental problem. It is a question of life and death. The creator's rule is based on the needs of the logical mind that allows humanity to exist. The rule of the second-hand man is based on the needs of people who will not be able to survive. Everything that arises from man's independent ego is good. Everything that arises from man's dependence on man is bad."

"The selfish person, in the strict sense, is not someone who sacrifices others. It is a person who has risen above the need to use others in any way. His functioning is not through other people. **He is not interested in them in the primary sense. His purpose, his thought, his desires and the source of his energy are always outside of them. He does not exist for another person, nor does he ask anyone to exist for him. This is the only brotherhood, the only mutual respect that can exist between people."

"Degrees and abilities may vary, but the basic principle is always the same. The degree of one's independence, initiative and personal love for one's work determines one's capacity as an employee and the value of one's work. Independence is the only measure of human virtues and human values. **A man's worth comes from himself, not from what he does or does not do for others.** There is no substitute for personal pride. There is no standard of personal pride other than independence."

"**In all proper relationships, there is no sacrifice of anyone to anyone.** The architect needs the clients, but he does not submit to their wishes in his own work. They need the architect too, but they do not order the house just to give him a sum of money. People exchange their work with each other by free mutual consent, for their common and mutual benefit, and they do so only if their personal interests coincide, if they both want this exchange. If not, they don't have to do business with each other. They go and look for others. This is the only kind of relationship that can exist between equals. Any other relationship is a master-slave relationship, a victim-executioner relationship."

"No work has ever been done collectively, never by majority decision. Every creative work is guided by the thought of a single individual. An architect needs many people to erect his building, but he does not ask them to vote for his design. They work together by free agreement and each is free in his own function. The architect uses steel, glass and concrete produced by others, but those materials remain steel, glass and concrete until the architect comes along and gets his hands on them. What the architect does with them is his own individual product and his own individual property. This is the only way of proper cooperation between people.

"The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to make his primary aim dependent on other people. His moral responsibility is to do what he wants, as long as what he wants is not something that is primarily dependent on other people. This includes the entire creative mind. both its thinking and its working. But it does not include the sphere of a gangster, nor that of a philanthropist, nor that of a dictator."

"One thinks alone, one works alone, but one alone... He cannot rob, exploit or rule. He needs victims to rob, exploit and rule. These are things that indicate dependence. They all fall under the domain of the second hand."

"Those who lead people are not egotists. They do not create anything. They exist only through others. Their purpose lies in those they rule, in their enslavement. They are as dependent as the beggar. They are as dependent as the social worker, as dependent as the bandit. The type of addiction does not matter. "

"But people have been taught to regard these second-handers... tyrants, emperors, dictators... as representatives of egoism. With this fraud, people are made to kill the ego. both in themselves and in others. The purpose of this fraud is actually to destroy the creators or to put them in chains. It is the same thing."

"Since the beginning of history, two adversaries have always faced each other. One is the creator and the other is the second hand. When the first creator invented the wheel, the first second-hand man reacted. He invented philanthropy."

"The Creator, in spite of being constantly denied, attacked, persecuted and exploited, has continued on his path and has propelled all of humanity forward with his own energy. The second messenger has no contribution to this process except to create obstacles. There is another name for this struggle... Here the individual is against the collective, the community."

"The 'common good' of the collective - of a race, a class, a state - is what underlies any regime of tyranny that oppresses people. Every horrible event in history appears to have been done for a good cause. Has any selfish act done any harm that can be measured by the blood shed by the benefactor? Does the blame for this lie in the hypocrisy of mankind, or in the nature of the principle itself? The most horrible butchers are often the most sincere, the most sincere believers. They genuinely believed that they could achieve a perfect society through the Gideonile or the firing squad. No one has ever questioned their right to kill because they are obviously killing for a benevolent cause. The sacrifice of human beings for the sake of other human beings is taken for granted.The actors change but the course of the tragedy remains the same. A humanist comes along, says that he loves human beings as much as he loves himself, and he ends up in a sea of blood. As long as people believe that for something to be good, it must be free of this selfishness, it has been and will continue to be so. This allows the benefactor to act and forces the victims to endure it. Every leader of the collectivist movement wants nothing for themselves, but look at the results."

"The only good thing a human being can do to another human being, the only way to have a proper relationship with that person... is to take your hand away!"

"Now let us look at the consequences of a society founded on the principle of individualism. This is Our country. The noblest country in human history. The land of the greatest achievements, the greatest prosperity, the greatest freedom. This country was not founded on selfless service. It was not founded on sacrifice, on acquiescence or on any principle of charity. It was founded on the right of the individual to seek his own happiness. His own happiness. Not someone else's. A private, personal and selfish goal, but look at the results. Look at your own conscience."

"This is an old conflict. People have come very close to the truth, but each time the tables have turned and this or that civilization has come to an end. Civilization is to move towards a society of private life. The whole life of the savage is public, governed by the rules of his tribe. Civilization is the process of liberating man from man."

"Today, in our day, collectivism, the theory of the second-hand man, the second-rate man, the old beast, is off its leash and running loose. It is reducing people to an unprecedented level of mental depravity. It is becoming an unprecedented horror. It has poisoned every mind. It has engulfed most of Europe. It is engulfing our country too."

"I am an architect. I know what will come out of the principles on which these are based. We are approaching a world in which I cannot allow myself to live."

"Now you know why I dynamited Cortlandt."

"I designed Cortlandt. I gave it to you. I destroyed it."

"I destroyed it because I didn't choose it to exist. It was a double monster, in form and in meaning. I had to blow them both up. Its form had been corrupted by second-handers who felt entitled to fix what they did not and could not create. They had been given the right to do this because of their belief that the charitable purpose of the building was above all rights, and that I had no right to oppose it."

"I agreed to design Cortlandt for the purpose of seeing it done as I had designed it, and for no other reason. I asked for this price for my work, which I was not paid."

"I don't blame Peter Keating, he was desperate. He had an agreement with the employers, but it was ignored. He was promised in that agreement that the building would be built according to the project. That promise was broken. The fact that a person respects the integrity and consistency of his work and tries to protect it is today defined as something vague, abstract, trivial. You heard the prosecutor say these words. Why was the building disfigured? There was no reason. There are never reasons for such things. It can only be that a second-hand man felt he had the right to tamper with something that belonged to someone else, something tangible or intangible. Who authorized them to do this? You won't find a single person among dozens of officials. No one cared to give permission or to stop it. No one was responsible. No one can be held to account. This is the structure of all collective action."

"I was not paid what I wanted or what I was entitled to, but the owners of Cortlandt took from me what they wanted. They wanted a building scheme that was as cheap as possible. They couldn't find anyone else who could do it the way they wanted. They took the benefits of my work and forced me to give it to them as a gift, but I'm not a philanthropist. I don't give such gifts."

"It was said that I demolished the houses of the poor and helpless. It was forgotten that without me, these poor people would not have had these houses in the first place. Those who were concerned about the poor had to come to me, someone who had no interest in them, to offer the help they wanted. Through the poverty of the future tenants, it was believed that these people had a right to my work. Their needs were seen as having a claim on my life. It was considered my duty to offer whatever contribution was asked of me. This is the motto of the second-hand man who is devouring the world today."

"**I have come today to tell you that no one has the right to a single minute of my life, not even my energy. Or any of my achievements. No matter who makes such a claim, no matter how large their numbers, no matter how great their needs."

"I wanted to come here and say that I am a person who does not live for others."

"It had to be said. The world is disappearing in a realm of sacrifice."

"I came here to say that one's honest and creative products are more important than any philanthropic endeavor. Those of you who cannot understand this are the ones who are ruining your world."

"I wanted to come here on my own terms, I don't want to exist on other terms."

"**I accept no other responsibility towards people, except one, and that is to respect their freedom, not to join a slave society.** If my country no longer exists, I can offer it ten years in prison. During those ten years, I will remember with gratitude what my country used to be like. My unwillingness to live and work in the new order that has replaced it is my loyalty."

"My loyalty is to all the creators who have ever lived, to all the creators who have suffered at the hands of the forces responsible for the Cortlandt I dynamited. It is my loyalty to every hour they had to spend alone and in torment, in denial, in despair, in exploitation. My loyalty is to all the creators who came into the world, lived, struggled, died before they succeeded, as an unrecognized person. My loyalty is to every creator who has been destroyed in body or spirit. My loyalty to Henry Cameron, to Steven Mallory, to any other person who does not wish to be named but who is sitting in this hall right now, who knows that I am addressing him."

Roark stood with both legs apart, arms hanging straight out to his sides, head held high. Like an unfinished building. Later, when he turned and sat down at the defense table, many in the room had the impression that they were still seeing him standing like that. That one glimpse was indelible.

During the long legal discussions that followed this speech, this picture was never erased from the minds of the audience. The judge reminded the prosecutor that the defendant had changed his plea. He had admitted that he had committed the act but had pleaded not guilty. This created a temporary legal confusion. It was left to the jury to decide whether the defendant knew what he was doing and, if so, whether he admitted that it was a bad act. The prosecutor did not object. There was a strange silence in the courtroom. The prosecutor believed he had already won the case. He made his closing statement, and no one remembered what he said. The judge instructed the jury. The jury got up and left the courtroom.

People were moving, getting ready to leave. They didn't act as if they were in a hurry. They would have to wait for hours anyway. Wynand at the back of the hall, Dominique on the other side, sitting perfectly still.

A bailiff came to Roark, prepared to escort him out. Roark stood up at the defense table. His eyes darted first to Dominique, then to Wynand, then followed the bailiff to the door.

Just as you were about to leave, there was a noise. After a moment of silence, people realized that there was a knock on the door of the jury room. The jury had reached its verdict.

Those who stood up stood up. They froze where they were. They waited until the judge came and took his seat. The jury returned to the courtroom and took their seats.

"The defendant will rise and face the jury," the bailiff shouted.

Howard Roark came forward and stood in front of the jury. At the back of the room, Gail Wynand also stood up. She was also standing.

- "Mr. Speaker, have you reached a decision?"

- "We've arrived."

- "What is your decision?"

- "Not guilty."

- The first movement of Roark's head was not to turn and look out of the window at the city, not to look at the judge or Dominique. He was looking at Wynand.

Wynand turned sharply and left the hall. He was the first to leave the hall.

## Bonus

"Howard, I'm a parasite. I've been a parasite all my life. You did all my best projects at Stanton. You drew the first house I ever built. You drew the Cosmo-Slotnick building. I've always fed off of you, men like you who lived before we were born, men who built the Parthenon, Gothic cathedrals, the first skyscrapers. Without them, I wouldn't know how to put a stone on a stone. I've never in my life added a single new door knob to what was done before me. I took what wasn't mine and gave nothing in return. I had nothing to give. I'm not pretending, Howard, I know exactly what I'm saying, and now I'm here to ask you to save me again. If you want to fire me, do it now."

---

"You made a mistake at the Stoddard Temple, Howard," he said. That statue should have been yours, not Dominique's."

- "No. I'm too egotistical I'm too egotistical to do that."

- "Egotistical? Egotists would love that. You use words in very strange ways."

- "In exactly the right sense. I don't want to be a symbol of anything, I'm just me."

---

Wynand asked. "Howard, have you ever been in love?"
Roark turned directly to him and answered in a low voice.

- "I'm still in love."

- "But isn't the feeling of walking through a building bigger than that?"

- "Much bigger, Gail."

- "I was thinking about people who say there can be no happiness in the world. How they struggle to find joy in living. Look how they struggle. Why should a living creature live in pain? Who has the right to ask a human being to live for any purpose other than his own joy? Every human being is after it. Every fiber of his body wants it. But they never find it. I wonder why? They whine, they complain that they can't find meaning in life. There is one kind of people I particularly hate. Those who are looking for a higher purpose, a universal purpose, who don't know what to live for. 'We have to find ourselves', you hear it from everybody everywhere. It has become the typical nonsense of our century. It's in every book you open. It's in every drooling person's confession. It is considered noble to admit it. But I think it should be the most shameful thing."

- "Look, Gail."

Roark stood up, reached down and plucked a thick branch from the tree, grabbed it with both hands, clenched his fists on either side of the branch, his wrists and knuckles contracting against its resistance. Roark slowly bent the branch like a bow. "Now I can make whatever I want from it. Bow, spear, walking stick, handrail. That is the meaning of life."

- "Your power?"

- "Your job."

He threw the branch to the side.

- "The material the world offers you and what you can make of it... What do you think?"

- His photo on my office wall.
