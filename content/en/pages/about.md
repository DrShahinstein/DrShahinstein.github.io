I am Taylan Öztürk (aka `DrShahinstein`). I have been involved with computers and the internet since I was a child. I used to play a lot of games really well and listen to a lot of foreign music. It was a start in terms of computer and language culture. Today, I still perform game streaming [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@bbunited_pvp) with friends on the weekends. As I got older, I became more productive and turned to areas like software programming, chess, philosophy, etc. I've always been a person who tries to do my job in the best way possible, so I have a considerable accumulation on my interests. I enjoy living with integrity and openness.

I have been writing code since late 2019. Human beings seem to be the only creatures that cannot be satisfied with survival and reproduction. The pursuit of happiness, the desire to be happy all the time is also inhuman. What satisfies the human is to create. This reminds me of the phrases in the holy books like "God breathed into man from his spirit". I believe that in order not to lose one's passion for the earth, one must not stop moving: it's like keeping a bicycle in constant motion to keep it balanced. Nietzche's fierce struggle with nihilism must have inspired me in this regard.<br/>
As a result, software programming was the first occupation where I created and put something out there. For a considerable period of time, I gained experience in web development. Over time, I got involved in different areas such as desktop application development, game development, linux programs, low level architecture, reverse engineering, etc. Eventually, I acquired a serious programming culture and my problem solving skills improved considerably. Thanks to this, even when I have to deal with areas I am not familiar with, I can perform the projects I want to put forward. I continue to pursue this culture with passion.

Chess is more rooted than programming. I first learned the movement of the pieces when I was in elementary school. Then I didn't play chess for a long time. I started playing chess again in the 8th grade, before I went to high school, and I got hooked with a very different interest than before. Chess philosophy, chess culture; it is a sharp building block of my character, my mindset.<br/>
Sometimes you fight for as long as 6 hours, you've made 50 good moves, but on the 51st move you make a small mistake and you lose everything. You are left with nothing but a bitter experience, and yet you know how to stand up and shake hands with your opponent and congratulate him. That's chess. It is the art of being a gentleman. There is no room for the dishonest, the dishonest person will quit chess in minutes. Because the more you deceive yourself, the more you sink. The rules are simple, everyone has to be mature enough to bear the responsibilities of the game they play. You cannot blame anyone but yourself.<br/>
The world is not really like that, but I am glad that chess exists and I am glad to be a member of this art. On my [GitHub](https://github.com/DrShahinstein) you can find my online chess accounts.

I would like to mention my interest in religion and philosophy together. Because religion is a view of life. And a view of life is based on a philosophy. Since I was 12 years old, I have been thinking about the meaning of life, death, morality, good and evil. Most of all I like to talk and think about moral philosophy, about good and evil.<br/>
The idea of God is a mathematical idea. Human beings, who question causality, want to connect the chain of causality to an end point because incomprehensible phenomena like infinity are not satisfactory enough to explain why there is something in the universe instead of nothing. Human beings are already uncomfortable with the uncertainty of creation, and adding concepts like infinity on top of the uncertainty will only make things worse.<br/>
Man searches for meaning. When one hears a song one has been humming while walking on the road, one does not want to pass it off as a coincidence. He wants to think that those who do good will find good, and those who do evil will one day return it back to them. Wow, look at the water, it's as though it was created for us! You say that it has no taste, no color, and without this thing we wouldn't exist. All this is wonderful...<br/>
Man is as ignorant as he seeks meaning. He knows so little about the universe that he has no choice but to invent gods to justify the meaning of his existence. Worse, this is a perfectly justified endeavor. Indeed, without god (a theistic idea of god), there is nothing left but nihilism. I believe that anyone who is honest with himself has two options for justifying the meaning of life and morality: Theism or nihilism. If one believes that God exists, one should keep this in mind and live accordingly. And if there is no God, one has to know what that means, because that is a really hard burden to bear. Nevertheless, honesty is my virtue, I believe in being honest, even if I know that it is an effect of the desire to search for meaning:<br/>

* "And if your opinion is defeated, your honesty should still cry triumph over that!"<br/>_(Thus Spoke Zarathustra)_
* "Before I can live with other folks I’ve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience."<br/>_(to Kill a Mockingbird)_
